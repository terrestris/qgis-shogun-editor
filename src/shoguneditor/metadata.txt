about=A QGIS plugin to connect with a Shogun GIS client instance on a remote or local server and edit it's content from QGIS. Supports editing and creating layers and applications, upload new styles from QGIS to Shogun and more. It's funcionalities are in some way similar to the Geoserver Exploerer plugin, but instead of accessing the base geoserver it only interacts with the Shogun2-Webapp client (RESTful) interface.
